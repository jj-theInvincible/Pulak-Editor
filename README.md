# Pulak-Editor
<h3>A lightweight Pure Text editor for Linux</h3>

Pulak-Editor is a simple and very Lightweight(~10MB) text editor for Linux Based Operating Systems. 

Version 1.0 has been built using Python Tkinter Module.

The source codes will be released in September 2019 and it will be open for contribution.

Future Scope includes changing the development and make it robust using gtk instead of python libraries which will make it faster.

Also, our Goal is to make it fastest text Editor in the Era where Very Slow, Code redundant Editors like Atom are gaining much popularity beacuse of their functionalities. We will to try to implement all features in future versions of Pulak.

One more concern is about ease of use of Devnagri script since hardly any Editor is offering it.
